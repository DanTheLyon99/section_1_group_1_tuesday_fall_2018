The program plays the game Boggle. The goal of the game is to find the most amount of words you can in a matrix of characters. The word must be 3 characters long and must be next to each other.

How to run:
Open the terminal in the folder containing all of the .c and .h files. Type the command "make" into the command line to compile the files. Then type the commmand "./run" to run the program. A matrix of characters will now appear on the screen. Enter the words that you find in the matrix. Once you are done playing type "n" to enter your name and save your score. To quit the game type "q". After you quit the program will display the scoreboard.
